Ask people to tell you words they associate with **database** and you will probably get **big** among the responses. Databases handle large amount of data, and everyone knows that. How big ? It depends whether you count the number of items in a database of the size of the items. The Library of Congress has 160 million items on 858 miles of shelving as of this writing. The catalog, which is based on a database, is available online a www.loc.gov/about/fascinating-facts/. There is no questions among people who are interested in databases that the Library of Congress catalog is far from the largest database in the world.(in all likelihood, the largest databases are not visible to the public because they contain classified corporat and governmental information).

This chapter provides an introduction or reminder about databases today an how they are used. If you have used databases in the past, much has changed, an if you have not used to them much in the past, this chapter will give you a quick overview.

# * [Moving Beyond Big](https://github.com/c4arl0s/SQLiteForMobilDevelopers#1-getting-up-to-speed-with-databases-and-sqlite)

Beyond **big**, you should start thinking about databases as being **structured** and **organized**. In fact, as a mobile developers, the structured and organized aspects of databases are much more important than their size. From the earliest days of the Web in the early 1990s, web browsers have used databases to store and organize their data. What Data, you may wonder ? How do you think your browser is able to store your passwords for the web pages in a cache so that they can be retrieved without a new network access when possible ? And what about your preferences for default font sizes ? Or the download folder for files you can change when you feel like it, and even on many browsers, restrictions on certain users or types of users ? These are just simple examples, but the principles apply even to the largest (and smallest) databases today
